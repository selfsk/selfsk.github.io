Recently I've attempted (yes, attempted) to get a [CMSP](https://cmsp.msi5.com/) (California Motorcyclist Safety Program) certification, to get a better understanding how people are getting prepared to ride a motorcycle.

I didn't go through, mostly because what I've seen and heared so far just make me worry about rider's safety and my internal conflict person just can not let it slide.

## My background

I've been riding for 5 years so far, not much in terms of time, but in that time I was able to put about 100k miles, doing various things - from communting to participate in racing. 

I never did a basic riding course, and was learning things on my own from books and videos available publicly on youtube (see [Links](#Links) at the bottom of post). After I get more expirienced riding motorcycle I enrolled in IRC (Intermediate Riding Course), which I finished without too much issues.

I did my first trackday shortly after finishing IRC, at Thunderhill East, with Z2 which was an awesome experience which really showed what bike is capable of, and how many I need to learn to become really proficient rider.

Fast forward to 2020, I did participate in AFM racing, only 1 round so far, didn't win anything but, again, was able to learn a lot about capabilities of my motorcycle (CBR600RR '08) and myself. In betwen of those dates I took an extra Ken Hill's riding school provided by [Carters@TheTrack](https://cartersatthetrack.com/) and practice with minibikes on kart tracks.

And that brings me to today, when I decided it is probably a good thing to get an instructor license to pass knowledge that I've aquired through this time and continue to develop further.

## The process

It is quite involved process and you need to have a lot of time to allocate to go through.

To get a license to teach CMSP, you need to go through:

 * Basic Riding Course - 2 days program, which all new riders are going through
 * Intermediate Riding Course ($350, but company will reimburse after 20 lessons completed, as instructor)- 1 day progam
 * MTC Instructor Training (MTCIT) ($495) - 7 days program (from 8am to 6pm, 8am to 9pm on Fri, and 7.30am to 6pm on weekend). Happens limited number of times per year, so if you can not participate you'd have to wait for next one, which could be next year.
 
 * Need to "shadow" instructors for both, classroom and range lessons, as much as possible.


## My experience

After I did a couple of "shadow" lessons I've decided to give it a try and enrolled in basic and intermediate courses, unfortunately (or fortunately, depends on point of view) couldn't sign up because of other matters (not related). 

I observed few things which I would consider a "red flag" while "shadowing" other instructors (I will outline those later), but decided to give a try anyway. 

My BRC first day was supposed to be raining, usually it's not a big thing, I had some share of riding in the rain - both on street and track. But that one wasn't great, so I decided actually dropped whole thing completely, and here is my reasoning:

 * new riders shouldn't be _learning_ how to ride a motorcycle in the rain. new riders already overwhelmed with amount of information and experience, what's the reason to add a huge variable (rain) in the mix is beyond my understanding.
 * organization of whole process was bad:
   - instructors didn't put a canopy(ies), so riders don't have to stand in rain while instructor explains things...
   - instructor didn't give me a rug to wipe seat from rain, and said "it is part of riding experience"... **news flash - it's not!**. Smart rider probably would try to avoid getting in the rain in first place!
   - keep in mind we're not talking about riding, we're talking about sitting, standing and moving with 5mph (10mph tops) for 4 hours!
   - I didn't want to spend 4 hours in the rain, just because.

So, after this awesome experience I decided it's not worth it - and simply bailed. But I did have a luxury to do so, I don't need to go through this miserable experience to get M1 because I have it already! I can not say the same for the rest of group, but I'm 100% at least couple of them were thinking the same...

## Red flags

Now to juicy part! **Red flags** which I've noticed while I was "shadowing" and participating:

  * Harley's as learning bike - that's is just wrong! No new rider should've faced 500lb motorcycle for first time
  * Outdated information, things like "Choke" - why on earth you need to overload a new rider's brain with information which is not relevant to current task?
  * No explanation how throttle and front brake works, besides simple things like "roll-on/off" and "squeeze"
  * Brief mention about that controls can be adjusted - but none were adjusted on range, and no demo of how to do such things
  * Some bizzare techniques about:
    - how to keep your throttle hand, which people would have to re-learn anyway. 
    - do not cover front brake - which might be ok for new riders
    - required all fingers over clutch lever - which basically makes your left hand somewhat useless for turning the bike, because you can only push on it, but not pull, which forces you to handle throttle in a way of "handlebar" not a control input!
    - going through turns, especially throttle use - which to sum up, just to "keep rolling it on through a turn", which is a valid technique but only if you understand what you're doing!
    

All those things are just a recipe for disaster, which I've witnessed too!
  * not properly adjusted throttle - person launched motorcycle, no one really got hurt, but it was a bit scary.
  * hand position - person was struggling to do basic stuff because the posture and hand positition (which they told to do) weren't allowing to control the bike.
  * going through turns - people just keep on rolling and leaning bikes at the same time - and we all know how it usually ends.
  * to make things worse - experienced riders (or riders who come from dirt riding) couldn't use techniques that they used to do, safety techniques like "covering brake" and use only "2 fingers on clutch" are not allowed!


## Bottom line

The more I learn about whole CMSP course the more I think it's money grab than education! 

You won't get explanation **WHY** you need to do things, but **WHAT** you should do, which doesn't help in long run, and only develops a very bad habits, which later contributes to bad experience riders are having.

Now, someone will wonder - "what's you would do, smart ass?". And I will answer this:
 - motorcycles are wonderful machines which require a lot of "mind" investment from rider - simply because error's consequences could be much higher
 - learning riding a motorcycle it's not the same as learning a riding bicycle, it should have done very thouroughly and almost individually.
 - you can not learn to riding a motorcycle in 2 days doing drill with bad techniques, because goal here is not to work on technique but send person on his way as soon as possible
 - new riders are overwhelmed with information _and_ feedback from physical activity. There is no need to make it harder by providing instructions in the rain!
 - each control requires probably couple of hours of drills to get used to it
 - there is no need to dump 4 hours of information at once
 
 I think ideal scenario would be a week long training, but only for 2 (3 max** hours per day, because:
  - not being overwhelmed allows person to reflect and process received knowledge and experience. It potentially allows riders to realize something or come up with clarification questions which they might have, and have an opporutinity to ask them
  - people do have jobs and other things, 

**Ultimate goal of any rider to have full (aka total) control of your motorcycle, but without proper techinques and properly adjusted controls it becomes infinite harder to achieve for new riders.**
