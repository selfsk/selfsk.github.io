Recently I've attempted (yes, attempted) to get a [CMSP](https://cmsp.msi5.com/) (California Motorcyclist Safety Program) certification, to get a better understanding how people are getting prepared to ride a motorcycle.

I didn't go through, mostly because what I've seen and heared so far just make me worry about rider's safety and my internal conflict person just can not let it slide.

## My background

I've been riding for 5 years so far, not much in terms of time, but in that time I was able to put about 100k miles, doing various things - from communting to participate in racing. 

I never did a basic riding course, and was learning things on my own from books and videos available publicly on youtube (see [Links](#Links) at the bottom of post). After I get more expirienced riding motorcycle I enrolled in IRC (Intermediate Riding Course), which I finished without too much issues.

I did my first trackday shortly after finishing IRC, at Thunderhill East, with Z2 which was an awesome experience which really showed what bike is capable of, and how many I need to learn to become really proficient rider.

Fast forward to 2020, I did participate in AFM racing, only 1 round so far, didn't win anything but, again, was able to learn a lot about capabilities of my motorcycle (CBR600RR '08) and myself. In betwen of those dates I took an extra Ken Hill's riding school provided by [Carters@TheTrack](https://cartersatthetrack.com/) and practice with minibikes on kart tracks.

And that brings me to today, when I decided it is probably a good thing to get an instructor license to pass knowledge that I've aquired through this time and continue to develop further.

## The process

It is quite involved process and you need to have a lot of time to allocate to go through.

To get a license to teach CMSP, you need to go through:

 * Basic Riding Course (**BRC**) (free) - 2 days program (15 hours), which all new riders are going through
 * Intermediate Riding Course (**IRC**) ($350, but company will reimburse after 20 lessons completed, as instructor)- 1 day progam
 * MTC Instructor Training (**MTCIT**) ($495) - 7 days program (60 hours). Happens limited number of times per year, so if you can not participate you'd have to wait for next one, which could be next year.
 
 * Need to "shadow" instructors for both, classroom and range lessons, as much as possible.
 * and some extra requirements, like background check, etc, usual stuff 

You can get more information on [CMSP site](https://cmsp.msi5.com/our_team.php)

## My experience

After I did a couple of "shadow" lessons I've decided to give it a try and enrolled in basic and intermediate courses, unfortunately (or fortunately, depends on point of view) couldn't sign up because of other matters (not related). 

While "shadowing" other instructors and being a customer on BRC, I observed few things which I consider a "red flag", and made me really hard to justify the need of going through whole process. I'll skip my experience as customer and get straight to things I treat as a "red flag".

### Bikes

There are some sites, which provides Harley Street 500, which weights 500lb, as a learning bike, but, here is a kicker, with "speed limiter" in first and second gears! Why not use same thing to prevent "whisky throttle". Not all facilities uses those, but I believe it becomes more prevalent around area.

My point is - *no new rider should've faced 500lb motorcycle as a learning tool*. It is simply contradict whole safety narrative program uses.

### Questionable techniques

* handle position on throttle - it's saying to keep wrist below knucles. As I understand to avoid ["whisky throttle"](https://www.motosport.com/blog/whiskey-throttle-vs-panic-rev#:~:text=Whiskey%20Throttle%20(or%20Whisky%20throttle,but%20at%20best%20hilarious%20moments.)), but I hear - "instead of teaching you proper throttle handling, we will hadicap you, so hopefully, you won't hurt you or other people on the range". 
* brake and clutch - oh... so many questions... 
   * do not cover brake? - I guess official reason is "So you wont stab on brakes and dump bike, and wont hurt and/or damage someone/thing". But again, on street it's advised to cover brakes, and I'm pretty sure IRC and total control book recommends the same, but why wont spend enough time on fresh rider to properly learn the brake usage?
   * cover clutch with all 4 fingers - my guess - "So student can disconnect engine from wheel", very good reasoning, but wont teach to cover and use with 2 fingers, so they can use rest of the hand/palm to better control motorcycle?
   
* cornering techniques - whole idea to roll on through the turn without explain why is extremely dangerous. Seeing how fresh students roll on and add lean angle is kind of scary. I didn't hear any explanation why we roll-on, which I believe is a key here!
  

### Riding in rain

Riding in the rain for new riders is just a great way to drive people away from this activity! 

New riders already overwhelmed with amount of information they need to process before the range, than to help process that information we will throw student into rain, because apparently "it is part of riding experience"... **news flash! - it is not!**. It contradicts what instructors teach people in classrom - "use expert judgement to avoid using expert skills" - if you have an option to do not ride in the rain, you will avoid it or plan around it. 


## Bottom line

Sadly, more I learn about whole CMSP course the less I'm sure it's about safety.

You won't get explanation **WHY** you need to do things, but **WHAT** you should do, which doesn't help in long run, and only develops a very bad habits, which later contributes to bad experience riders are having.

Now, someone will wonder - "what's you would do, smart ass?". And I will answer this:
 - motorcycles are wonderful machines which require a lot of "mind" investment from rider - it means to get a better understanding of topic(whatevere it might be) - practice and learning should be incremental. Do not overload rider's brain with 5 things, overload with 1-2 at a time (i.e. in one lesson). There is no need to dump 4 hours of information at once
 - learning riding a motorcycle it's not the same as learning a riding bicycle, it should have done very thouroughly and almost individually.
 - you can not learn to riding a motorcycle in 2 days doing drill with bad techniques, because goal seems to be is _not_ to work on technique but send person on his way to DMV as soon as possible
 - new riders are overwhelmed with information _and_ feedback from physical activity. There is no need to make it harder by variables which can be eliminated (i.e. riding in the rain)
 - each control requires probably couple of hours of drills to get used to it
 
I think ideal scenario would be a week long training, but only for 2 (3 max) hours per day, because:
 - not being overwhelmed allows person to reflect and process received knowledge and experience. It potentially allows riders to realize something or come up with clarification questions which they might have, and have an opporutinity to ask them
 - people might have a busy schedule, but it's easier to find 2 hours (and it can broke down in different weeks even), than half of the day.

**Ultimate goal of any rider to have full (aka total) control of your motorcycle, but without proper techinques and properly adjusted controls it becomes infinite harder to achieve for new riders.**

Information sources
* [Yamaha Chamion Riding School](https://www.youtube.com/user/ridelikeachampion) - although it sounds like racing school, but it's really for every type of riding!
* [Dave Moss](https://davemosstuning.com/) - a massive amount of information on all aspects of owning the bike. From buying, to riding, adjusting, maintaining, etc.
