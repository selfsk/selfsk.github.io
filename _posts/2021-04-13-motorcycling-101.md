# 101?

In this post I'm trying to share my vision of "motorcycling 101", or "what I think should be taught to people who start riding motorcycles for the first time". I think current approach to preparing brand new people for riding motorcycles is [somewhat confusing...](/motorcycles/education/learning/2021/03/18/how-i-didnt-become-an-instructor.html). I'm trying to focus on fundamentals, since the lack of focus in that area I noticed in Basic Riding Course.

The basics and foundation of riding a motorcycle is not harder than riding a bicycle. Complexity is coming from each bike's input (things like throttle, brakes, lean angle, steering) as well as rider's input (like vision, hearing, feeling), each can be adjusted within a broad spectrum and with different granularity!

# New rider

I think the most exciting thing about being a new rider is to experience things for the first time! Things like accelerating over 40mph (yes, 40mph will seem like a warp-speed), braking or leaning a bike over 20 degrees. This excitement is a great feeling, remember it :) and prepare to start working on keeping this excitement in check! 

Over time the excitement subsides and you start noticing other things, like what you feel through you hands, feet, legs, butt, etc. You need to process that data constantly while you're riding, and even some time while you're not!

`Moto-self-awareness` - new rider barely understands what's going on the bike alone, not even mentioning the real world road conditions. These are starting developing moto-self-awareness, it is the same thing as people who start doing yoga or exercising, become more aware about how things work, so they can use that to improve(hopefully) their level, in our case we want to improve our riding skills.

You're just starting your path of learning yourself and your motorcycle! Have fun and stay upright!


# Stay upright

The goal of any rider (of any level, any type of riding, etc.) is to **STAY UPRIGHT!** (or to keep riding)

How are we doing it? By balancing our machine while it moves through space! It is that simple... **NOT!**

For starters, we need to learn inputs that can _control_motion through space. I put those inputs in 2 groups - `speed` and `direction`:
- `speed`
  * throttle
  * brake
 
- `direction`
  * handlebars
  * body

There is one more thing... the most important one - `mental fitness`. 

Riding a motorcycle requires additional processing and analyzing of what you see(most important), hear, feel or even smell. Both input groups are based on that - lack of `mental fitness` will causes problems! Things like target fixation is one of them...

It is critical to understand that all groups are intertwined - even if you have a _good_ control over speed and direction, but mental fitness is lacking(you cannot process all the inputs on the same level(i.e. eyes, ears, hands, feet) at the same rate) - it's easy to go over your head! It is true the other way around, your `mental fitness` can be at _good_ level, but speed and/or direction are not. Abrupt(not sudden) inputs are an example of that.

By using combination of these groups we are balancing our machine! **In simpler terms - bike needs to move fowrard to stay upright. As long as a rider controls where and how it goes, and there is a surface to ride on, bike will be upright.**

Complexity of riding motorcycle comes from almost infinite scale of adjustement in each of these groups, and each item in group. It is infinite because as you learn, bar moves ahead too! 

Simple analogy that I think fits here - you have a ruler with only meter/yard marks - so all that you can work with are things which are about the size of 1 meter/yard - while you're progressing in your moto-self-awareness journey,  that ruler getting replaced with one with 1cm/feet marks, further you developing - it will go even to smaller sizes - 1mm/inch and so on. Going from 1 meter/yard marks to 1cm/feet can be quick, but the finer granularity you want to be with your inputs - the harder it will be to achieve this. 


#### Note on clutch

I didn't include cluth in any of the groups above because, I don't treat it as a main input, but auxilliary(i.e. electric bikes don't have ones, neither scooters). I suggest to treat cluth as a lever that disconnects engine power from a rear wheel and it's your safety lever if bike scared you!

Important part to practice for a new rider is "friction zone" - but I believe by doing slow speed drills you will practice it anyway.
