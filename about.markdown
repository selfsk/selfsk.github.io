**Not teaching anyone, just sharing my thoughts**

---

Hello,

My name is Sergei(pronounce like [Ser-Gay](https://www.quora.com/How-do-Russians-pronounce-the-name-spelt-Sergei)), I like computers, motorcycles and health related topics.

My life has been deeply intertwined with computers for couple decades, so far, and recently I've picked up a new passion - motorcycling. 

Now I'm trying to figure how to use knowledge that I've accumulated in various areas of my life and apply to things that I believe are important:
 * make computers work better
 * make riders be safer out there
 * make people live healthy
 
 
My "wisdom" collection: (mostly thoughts that I think make sense and help me navigate through various experiences)
 * Life begins at the end of your comfort zone - this blog is part of it
 * State of your mind is reflection on the world - having control of that state might help achieve great results
 * Find your rhythm of life - to be able to plan ahead
 * Follow your passion - with passion, person can achieve impossible things
