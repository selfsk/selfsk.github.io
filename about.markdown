**Not teaching anyone, just sharing my thoughts**

---

Hello,

My name is Sergei, I like computers, motorcycles and health(mental, physicall) related topics.

My life is deeply intertwined with computers for couple decades and recently I've picked up new passion - motorcycling. 
Now I'm trying to figure how to use knowledge that I've accumulated in various areas of my life and apply to things that I believe are important:
 * make computers work better
 * make people live healthy
 * make riders be safer out there
 
 
My "wisdom" collecton: (mostly thoughts that I think make sense and help me navigate through various experiences)
 * Life begins at the end of your comfort zone - this blog is part of it. 
 * State of your mind is reflection on the world - having control of that state might help you achieve great results
 * Find your rythm of life - to be able to plan ahead
 * Follow your passion - with passion person can achieve imppossible things
